# 💡 Daily C Programming Project

Welcome to my **Daily C Programming Project** repository!  
This repo contains a series of **small, focused C programs** that I build daily to improve my coding logic, programming discipline, and understanding of the C language.

Each folder represents one day’s challenge — complete with source code and clear problem descriptions.
